## Files:
- *patient_selection.ipynb* - notebook to generate a list of ICU patients that meet certain criteria.

## Folders:
- *data* - contains db_details.npy (the login details for my local database), as well as being the folder where outputs of the notebooks are stored
- *queries* - contains PostgreSQL queries used to access data in MIMIC-III.

## Not included in this repository:
- these notebooks require the MIMIC-III database (https://mimic.physionet.org/) to be locally installed.
- outputs of these notebooks are stored in *data*, however they haven't been uploaded here because of storage constraints.
